                        The term derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark. Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the underlying asset.

                        Synthetic assets, sometimes referred to as synths, are a combination of cryptocurrencies and traditional derivative assets. In other words, synths are tokenized derivatives. ... With this popularity, new forms of assets emerge, which cater to the needs of a wider group of users. Among these new assets are synthetic assets.

                        Instead of using contracts to create the chain between an underlying asset, the derivative product, synthetic assets tokenize the relationship. This means that synthetic assets can impart exposure to any asset in the world â€” all from within the crypto ecosystem.

                      Traditional derivatives were once groundbreaking in their ability to unlock additional value from assets such as commodities. However, crypto synthetic assets are taking liquidity access to a whole new level. Here are just a few advantages synthetic assets have over traditional derivatives:
                        -Anyone can issue them: Blockchain-based synthetic assets can be minted by anyone using open-source protocols like Synthetix and Mirror.
                        -Worldwide liquidity: Synthetics can be traded on any crypto exchange in the world, including unstoppable decentralized exchanges.
                        -Borderless transfers: Synthetic assets are blockchain assets like ERC-20 tokens; you can send and receive them between standard cryptocurrency wallets.
                        -Frictionless movement: Switch between equities, synthetic silver/gold, and other assets without having to hold the underlying asset.
